# C++ Callbacks, Signals & Slots
C++ Callbacks, Signals and Slots implementation based on variadic templates

An implementation inspired by Herb Sutter's article Style Case Study #2: Generic Callbacks (http://www.gotw.ca/gotw/083.htm) and kjellkod's KSignal code (https://sites.google.com/site/kjellhedstrom2/signalandslots).
